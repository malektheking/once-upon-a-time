Once Upon A Time there was a knight in the forest
He was in search of the sword known as the "Excalibur"
some say only the ones with King Authors blood can weild the blade "Excalibur"
He approaches a boulder, that boulder which holds the Excalibur
He pulls the sword out, he conquers the world using the sword
